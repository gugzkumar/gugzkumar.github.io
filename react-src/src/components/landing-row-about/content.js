    description: <>
      I've solved problems across a variety of industries including Government, Supply Chain, Healthcare, E-Commerce, even Cosmetics.
      Currently I work for <b><a href="https://www.elephantventures.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elephant Ventures</a></b>.
      <br/><br/>
      My belief is to build <b>Products over Software</b> and that being able to <b>communicate effectively</b> and <b>working with others</b> is more important than any Tech you know.
      <br/><br/>
      I also have a personal blog on this website that I try to use as an outlet to the share the things I've learned as an engineer.
